# Mahida's Film/Book Survey!

This extensive code heavy project is a Python based project that is deployed within a terminal. The survey is designed to be taken by users who are either film or book enthusiasts. The extensive nature of the code in this project allows users to choose between either a film or a book survey and depending on their choices they will recieve a tailor-made survey that respects their option. The key in this project was to create a fluid working survey using Python that stores data and can give it back to the user if they so wish by viewing the statistics in the sheet that stores the data entries of the survey. This project could have been 300 lines, 400 lines maybe 500 lines of code... However, the goal was to create a level of complexity and make sure users have many options to choose from and a reasonable amount of questions to answer.
